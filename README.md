# [PYTORCH] Deep Q-learning for playing Flappy Bird

Source: https://github.com/uvipen/Flappy-bird-deep-Q-learning-pytorch/tree/master

Train your model from scratch by running python train.py
Test your trained model by running python test.py

+ train.py is responsible for the training phase, where the DQN learns to play Flappy Bird through interactions with the environment.
+ test.py focuses on evaluating the trained model by running it in the game environment without further updates to the model parameters.
